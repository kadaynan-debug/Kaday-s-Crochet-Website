            In most patterns, you start a row with a turning chain, which you see here under the hook. It usually counts as a stitch, and for double crochet, it consists of chain 3; the three chain stitches are about the same height as a double crochet stitch. Your pattern will tell you whether or not to count it. With one loop on the hook, take the yarn over your crochet hook.
           </p>
           <p>
            Insert your crochet hook into the stitch or space desired. If you're starting with a foundation chain, skip the three chains closest to the hook and insert the hook in the fourth chain. For a sample like this, insert the hook in the second stitch, not the one at the base of the turning chain. With your hook in the stitch, take the yarn over the crochet hook again. As you wrap the yarn over, it's like wrapping the yarn over before you inserted the hook. The difference is that there's more yarn on your hook, so it's a little more difficult to maneuver. You'll soon get the hang of the motion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pull the yarn through the stitch. You now have three loops on your hook. Take the yarn over the crochet hook again and pull the yarn through the first two loops on your hook. You now have two loops remaining on your hook. Take the yarn over the crochet hook one last time and pull the yarn through the remaining two loops on your hook. You've completed one double crochet stitch! Repeat these steps in each stitch across the row.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you reach the end of the row, chain three to create a turning chain, turn your work, and begin working double crochet stitches into each stitch across the row. Remember to always check your pattern to see if the turning chain counts as a stitch. Double crochet creates a fabric that is taller and more open than single crochet or half double crochet, making it ideal for projects like shawls, blankets, and garments that benefit from a bit of drape and flexibility.
