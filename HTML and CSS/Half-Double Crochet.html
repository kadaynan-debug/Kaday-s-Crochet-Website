            The Half Double Crochet stitch (HDC in US terms) is one of the basic crochet stitches and is very easy to learn. It's also one of the most common stitches in crochet and is a favourite of mine for creating cozy winter projects. To create a Half Double Crochet stitch, you start by yarn over (YO) the hook, insert the hook into the stitch, YO again and pull through the stitch (you now have three loops on your hook). YO once more and pull through all three loops on the hook. This stitch creates a fabric that is thicker than single crochet but not as tall as double crochet, making it perfect for blankets, scarves, and hats.

            The half double crochet (HDC) stitch is generally considered an easy stitch to learn, as it involves fewer steps than some other crochet stitches. It is a good choice for beginners who are just learning how to crochet, as it is, in my opinion, a little easier to work than a double crochet (DC) stitch. The HDC stitch creates a fabric that is thicker and warmer than single crochet (SC) but not as tall as double crochet (DC), making it a versatile stitch for a variety of projects.

            Since the half double crochet stitch is worked with three loops on the hook, it can be a bit more challenging to maintain even tension compared to single crochet. However, with practice, most beginners can quickly become comfortable with this stitch. And since the stitch is versatile, it can be used in a variety of projects. Such as, granny squres, blankets, texured stitches and more. It creates a dense fabric that is warm and cozy, making it a great choice for winter accessories like scarves and hats.
