            The modified stitch I created is a combination of the single crochet and half-double crochet stitches. To create this stitch, I start with a foundation chain of the desired length. Then, I insert my hook into the second chain from the hook and pull up a loop. Next, I yarn over and pull through one loop on the hook, leaving two loops on the hook. I then yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook to complete the modified stitch. This creates a stitch that is taller than a single crochet but shorter than a half-double crochet, resulting in a unique texture that resembles knitting.

            This modified stitch is great for creating projects that require a bit more texture and warmth, such as scarves, blankets, and hats. The stitch creates a dense fabric that is both cozy and visually interesting. Additionally, the stitch is relatively easy to learn, making it accessible for beginners who are looking to expand their crochet skills.

            One of the benefits of this modified stitch is its versatility. It can be used in a variety of projects and can be easily adapted to different yarn weights and hook sizes. The stitch also creates a fabric that has a bit of stretch, making it comfortable to wear and use. Overall, I am very pleased with how this modified stitch turned out and I look forward to using it in future crochet projects. Such as gifiting my friends and family with handmade items that showcase this unique stitch.
